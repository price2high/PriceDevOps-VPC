# Project Inspiration

The inspiration came during my hands-on training building secure VPC architectures. I realized a VPC isn't just a networking tool — it's a shell that can be cloned and tailored to fit different clients, systems, or environments.

That shell became the foundation for **Price DevOps**: a company that turns complex cloud infrastructure into accessible and scalable solutions.

The goal: empower clients with secure VPC-based architectures, whether they’re migrating from legacy systems, building out hybrid cloud solutions, or automating smart offices and homes.
